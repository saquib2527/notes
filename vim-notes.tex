	\item[ESC] command mode

\section{Searching}
\begin{description}
	\item[/search-term] searches forward
	\item[n] steps to the next match

	\item[:set hlsearch] highlights the matched words
	\item[:nohlsearch] disables highlight, same as \emph{noh}
	\item[\\n\\n] searches blank lines
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item vim remembers the recent search, so typing \emph{n} or \emph{N} we can navigate through the matches 
	\item we can also search regular expressions
	\item \emph{d} and then \emph{/search-term} deletes everything from where the cursor is to the first match, also works with \emph{c} and \emph{y}

	\item next we carry out a series of commands
