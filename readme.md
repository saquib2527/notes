# About
This is an ongoing project where I'll be adding notes on various topics as I learn those day by day.  
So it's better to keep in touch for regular updates.

# How to use
Just download the files. To compile into pdf you have to invoke **pdflatex** passing as argument the filename.  
```
pdflatex python-notes.tex
```
