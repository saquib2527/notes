\section{Starting and Stopping Mongo}
\begin{itemize}
	\item first ensure \emph{/data/db} is present and has write permissions
	\item to start mongodb server invoke \verb|mongod|, to stop server hit \verb|Ctrl-C|
	\item to start shell invoke \verb|mongo|, to exit \verb|exit|
	\item if an error is shown as unclean shutdown, we need to invoke mongod with repair parameter
		\begin{verbatim}
			mongod --repair
		\end{verbatim}
	\item if it says already an instance of mongod is running, we can find and kill the process, followed by repair
\end{itemize}
